/*
This program simulates the growth and mutation of a bacterial colony in a lab over a period of time.
It includes phases for reproduction, death, and mutations, which can be either beneficial or harmful.
The simulation runs for a specified number of cycles and prints the population after each cycle.

This program is deliberately riddled with syntax errors for you to find and correct.

This example was created with A.I. (with extra mistakes added by hand) by Dr. Scott Feister for CS M125.
